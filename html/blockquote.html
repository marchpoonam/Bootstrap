    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming 
    language that is designed to have as few implementation
    dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming 
    language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),
    [16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support 
    Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled 
    to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the 
    underlying computer architecture. Although its syntax is similar to that of C
    and C++, the Java language has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
    The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime 
    code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled 
    languages.</blockquote>
